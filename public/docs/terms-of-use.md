## Terms of Use

### 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using SandBlox ("the Platform"), you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms of Use. The Platform is an open-source blockchain integration solution provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.

### 2. Open Source License

```typescript
const licenseTerms = {
  type: 'MIT License',
  permissions: [
    'Commercial use',
    'Modification',
    'Distribution',
    'Private use'
  ],
  conditions: [
    'License and copyright notice must be included',
    'No liability',
    'No warranty'
  ]
};
```

### 3. Web3 Considerations

1. **Blockchain Interactions**
   - Users are responsible for all blockchain transactions
   - Gas fees and network costs are user responsibility
   - Smart contract interactions are irreversible
   - Private key management is user responsibility

2. **Decentralized Nature**
   - Platform operates on decentralized networks
   - No central authority controls transactions
   - Network conditions may affect performance

### 4. Professional Usage

```typescript
const professionalGuidelines = {
  development: {
    standards: ['Clean code', 'Documentation', 'Testing'],
    security: ['Audits', 'Best practices', 'Regular updates'],
    compliance: ['Industry standards', 'Regulatory requirements']
  },
  support: {
    community: 'Open source collaboration',
    enterprise: 'Professional services available'
  }
};
```

### 5. Liability Disclaimer

1. **No Warranty**
   - Platform provided "AS IS"
   - No guarantees of performance
   - No responsibility for data loss
   - No financial advice provided

2. **Risk Acknowledgment**
   ```typescript
   const userAcknowledgment = {
     risks: [
       'Cryptocurrency volatility',
       'Smart contract vulnerabilities',
       'Network disruptions',
       'Regulatory changes'
     ],
     responsibility: 'User assumes all risks'
   };
   ```

### 6. Intellectual Property

1. **Open Source Components**
   - MIT Licensed components
   - Third-party licenses respected
   - Attribution requirements maintained

2. **Proprietary Elements**
   - Enterprise features may have separate terms
   - Custom implementations remain user property
   - Documentation is freely available

### 7. Security Requirements

```typescript
const securityRequirements = {
  userObligations: {
    authentication: 'Multi-factor when available',
    keyManagement: 'Secure private key storage',
    monitoring: 'Regular security checks'
  },
  platformMeasures: {
    audits: 'Regular security audits',
    updates: 'Security patches provided',
    notifications: 'Security alerts system'
