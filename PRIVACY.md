**Effective Date: March 12, 2025**  

This Privacy Policy applies to SandBlox (the "Application"), a blockchain-based development environment hosted on Cloudflare Pages. SandBlox is developed and operated by Particle Crypto Security, based in Ashdod, Israel.  

## 1. Our Commitment to Privacy  

We prioritize user privacy and minimize data collection wherever possible. SandBlox is designed to operate **without collecting or storing personal user data.**

- Names, email addresses, or phone numbers  
- Physical addresses or location data  
- Wallet private keys or seed phrases  
- Personally identifiable information of any kind  

All user-related data is **stored locally on the user's device** and never transmitted to our servers.  

## 3. Publicly Available Blockchain Data  

The Application may access and analyze publicly recorded blockchain data, including:  

- Transaction volume and activity  
- Smart contract interactions (e.g., function calls, event logs)

This data is used solely for platform development and improvement. **SandBlox does not attempt to link blockchain activity to individual identities.**  

## 4. Third-Party Services  

SandBlox integrates with the following third-party services, each with its own privacy policy:  

- **Cloudflare Pages** (Hosting)  
  - Collects anonymized technical data (e.g., IP addresses, browser type) for security and performance optimization.  
  - Cloudflare does not collect personally identifiable information.

Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these third-party services.  

## 5. Data Permanence on the Blockchain  

Blockchain transactions are **immutable and publicly visible.** Once recorded, they **cannot be modified or deleted.** Users are responsible for ensuring that any data they include in blockchain transactions is appropriate for permanent public storage.  

## 6. Self-Hosting  

SandBlox can be **self-hosted** using Docker, giving users full control over their environment. If you choose to self-host, **you are solely responsible** for security measures and compliance with applicable laws.  

## 7. Security & Liability Disclaimer  

SandBlox provides **a development framework** for interacting with smart contracts. We do not guarantee the security of third-party applications built using SandBlox.  

- **Users are responsible for evaluating risks** when interacting with third-party smart contracts.  
- **Particle Crypto Security holds no liability** for financial losses, security vulnerabilities, or privacy breaches resulting from third-party implementations.  

## 8. Age Restriction  

The Application is intended for users **18 years and older.** We do not knowingly provide services to minors.  

## 9. Smart Contract Changes & Updates  

SandBlox may introduce **new smart contract features** or upgrades. While we strive to maintain backward compatibility:  

- **Users should regularly review contract upgrades.**  
- **Changes in smart contracts do not affect past blockchain transactions.**  

## 10. Cookies & Local Storage  

SandBlox itself **does not use cookies or tracking technologies.** However, **third-party integrations (e.g., RainbowKit) may store local data for functional purposes.**  

Users should check the privacy policies of third-party tools for details on their use of cookies.  

## 11. Compliance with Privacy Laws  

Although SandBlox does not collect personal data, we adhere to privacy best practices and aim to align with:  

- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**  
- **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**  

*Note:* Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, **some privacy rights (e.g., right to erasure) may not apply to on-chain data.**  

## 12. Changes to This Policy  

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Users are encouraged to review it for any changes.  

If significant updates occur, we may notify users through SandBlox, but **we are not obligated to provide direct notice.**
